## How to install
This is a Spigot plugin. To install it, first you need to install the Spigot server jar. You can find it on various places, but I prefer the most https://mcutils.com/server-jars - they have a very initiutive UI, and have a really large choice.

After installing Spigot, you need to create the plugins directory, inside the folder where you've placed the server jar. There, you need to drop this plugin's jar file.

Now, when you've these steps completed, the plugin should be installed. Run `java -jar [serverFile.jar]`, then change the file `eula.txt` to contain `eula=true`, launch again, and connect to your local server. The ThrowableFireballs plugin should be available through /plugins or /throwablefireballs.
